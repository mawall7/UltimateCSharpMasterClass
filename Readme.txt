About Project Assignments from Udemy C Sharp Masterclass for 2024 -

I split the assignments for the course into two Solutions/Repositories 
on GitHub. If an assignment is not found there the explanations for that 
is I allready had aquired the same skills from working with other 
projects in the past and therefore didn't feel it necessary to do
that project / assignment at the time.
Some of my solutions for the projects may differ a bit from the course,
since it involved some experimenting on my own, but, the final result
is the same. I mainly followed 
the solutions presented, to get the most out of the course.
